Title: Sxmo‚ÄîSimple and Suckless X Mobile Pinephone UI

Just yesterday I stumbled on the [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23261839) about **Sxmo: Simple X Mobile ‚Äì A Pinephone UI that is simple and suckless**. I needed to try this out, OF COURSE‚Ä¶

Tiling window manager (Suckless' `dwm`) as a mobile Linux phone UI‚Ä¶ tailor made Pinephone button actions‚Ä¶ swipe gestures‚Ä¶ context menu (Suckless' dmenu)‚Ä¶ onscreen keyboard‚Ä¶ scripts‚Ä¶ ü§ìÔ∏è

All this is especially interesting to me, as I'm using [suckless](http://suckless.org/) programs (`st`, `dmenu`; though not `dwm` but `i3-gaps`) on my daily driver (as of writing a ThinkPad T25  running [REGOLITH](https://regolith-linux.org/) on top of [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)).

Installation went smoothly, afterwards login screen is greeting:

The overall experience is certainly interesting, to say the least.

While I clearly wouldn't want to use this as my main mobile phone interface, I will totally consider this as a preferred UI for ultra-mobile (a.k.a. "on the go") terminal usage (think: ssh'ing into servers).

But then‚Äîunfortunaltely‚ÄîI had to wipe the device in order to (yet again) switch OS. This time to Ubuntu Touch (UBports), as I'm looking fwd. to test the [OTA feature](https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=9796)‚Ä¶

Well, I guess one Pinephone is simply not enough for me ü§∑
