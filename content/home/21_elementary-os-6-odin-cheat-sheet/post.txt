Some useful commands that I cannot or do not want to remember or that I use regularly:

## Maintenance

```bash
sudo apt update \
   && sudo apt upgrade \
   && sudo apt dist-upgrade \
   && sudo apt autoremove \
   && sudo apt autoclean \
   ; flatpak update \
   ; sudo fwupdmgr update
```

## Fingerprint Reader

On ThinkPad T25 (T470) one needs to patch, build and install `libfprint` driver for `0097 Validity Sensors, Inc` :

1. Install and test (link: https://github.com/3v1n0/python-validity text: python-validity fork) (instead of snap)
2. Clone (link: https://github.com/3v1n0/libfprint/ text: `libfprint` driver repo)
3. Apply (link: https://gitter.im/Validity90/Lobby?at=5ef3033fb8152d34845e5356 text: patch for  sensor 0097) as referenced in (link: https://github.com/3v1n0/libfprint/issues/12 text: this issue)
4. Build and install `libfprint` (requires `meson`, `ninja`)

```bash
# setup
sudo apt install libpam-fprintd
sudo systemctl start fprintd

# enroll
fprintd-enroll
sudo pam-auth-update --enable fprintd
# sudo pam-auth-update --enable sudo
# sudo pam-auth-update --enable ssh
```

## UI Customization

E.g. Gala Plugins, etc

- Aral's uber awesome (link: https://github.com/small-tech/catts text: "Calmer Alt-Tab Task Switcher").
