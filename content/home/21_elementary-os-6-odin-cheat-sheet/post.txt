Some useful commands that I cannot or do not want to remember or that I use regularly:

## Maintenance

```bash
sudo apt update \
   && sudo apt upgrade \
   && sudo apt dist-upgrade \
   && sudo apt autoremove \
   && sudo apt autoclean \
   ; flatpak update \
   ; sudo fwupdmgr update
```

## Pantheon Tweaks

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:philip.scott/pantheon-tweaks
sudo apt install -y pantheon-tweaks
```

## Battery

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install tlp
sudo tlp start
```

## Fingerprint Reader

On ThinkPad T25 (T470) one needs to patch, build and install `libfprint` driver for `0097 Validity Sensors, Inc` :

1. Install and test (link: https://github.com/3v1n0/python-validity text: python-validity fork) (instead of snap)
2. Clone (link: https://github.com/3v1n0/libfprint/ text: `libfprint` driver repo)
3. Apply (link: https://gitter.im/Validity90/Lobby?at=5ef3033fb8152d34845e5356 text: patch for  sensor 0097) as referenced in (link: https://github.com/3v1n0/libfprint/issues/12 text: this issue)
4. Build and install `libfprint` (requires `meson`, `ninja`)

```bash
# setup
sudo apt install libpam-fprintd
sudo systemctl start fprintd

# enroll
fprintd-enroll
sudo pam-auth-update --enable fprintd
# sudo pam-auth-update --enable sudo
# sudo pam-auth-update --enable ssh
```

## UI Customization

E.g. Gala Plugins, etc

Aral's uber awesome (link: https://github.com/small-tech/catts text: Catts (Calmer Alt-Tab Task Switcher)).

Install (link:https://fishshell.com/ text: fish shell) by simply followin—again—(link:https://ar.al/2021/07/25/fish-shell/ text:one of Aral's write-ups).

For then enabling the font used by (link:https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide text:tide) do the following:
 
For *elementary Terminal* use this command: `gsettings set io.elementary.terminal.settings font 'MesloLGS NF'`
  
For *Visual Studio Code* and *Codium* to enable fish shell and font adjust `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json` as follows:
```
{
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "fish",
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "fish (login)": {
            "path": "fish"
        }
    }
}
```
