I'm quite exited by the idea as well as the team behind [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): a mesh VPN‚Äîclaiming and aiming for "Private networks made easy [finally]"‚Ä¶

> Tailscale is a mesh VPN that makes it easy to connect your devices, wherever they are. No more fighting configuration or firewall ports. 

I learned about *Tailscale* this week from my Twitter timeline‚Äîactually by multiple, "high profile" signals.

It's making use of [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), w/ services and glue code implemented in Go, supports multiple SSO provider (for now I'm using Google)‚Ä¶ and will eventually open-sourced (at some point).  

The [use cases/ solutions](https://tailscale.com/kb/Solutions) it can be applied to, really seem endless‚Ä¶ ü§îÔ∏è

- simple VPN for remote offices‚Äîof course I'm thinking co-working spaces ;-) 
- seamless connectivity to dev/ stage machine of yours or co-worker, especially in remote/ distributed teams 
- create a mesh network of your ~~IoT~~ embedded device fleat‚Äîthink Raspberry Pi et al.
- create a mesh network of distributed‚Äîeven multi-cloud‚Äî(micro) services and APIs
- ‚Ä¶

Settings up Tailscale is simple and absolutely straight forward‚Äîfor me so far only on Linux and iOS‚Äîbut for your likely as simple on macOS, Windows (Android coming soon-ish) ‚Äî‚Ä∫ [Getting Started with Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install)
