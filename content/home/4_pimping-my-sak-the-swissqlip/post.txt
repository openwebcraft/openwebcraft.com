Title: Pimping my SAK—The SwissQlip

----

Text:

I was intrigued by the idea of pimping my _Spartan PS_ SAK w/ a pocket clip…

So, back in July 2019, I backed the Indiegogo Campaign for "SwissQlip: Make the greatest multitool even better".

> A stainless steel pocket clip engineered to fit on most 91mm Victorinox Swiss Army Knives

The [campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/swissqlip-make-the-greatest-multitool-even-better/x/13905644#/)—by US company Stat Gear—was highly successful, funded in under 24 hours.

Thankfully—based on feedback from the backer community—the original design was revised to an even more sleek design ensuring a fully **deep-carry** experience. Yay!

I opted for the black version w/ out engraving.

I received the SwissQlip this week.

Attaching it to my _Spartan PS_ was easy. The packaging even included a mini Philips screw driver. Though I would clearly prefer receiving my gear (or gadgets) w/ out these "extras" (screw drivers, USB cabels, etc.) —for environmental/ sustainability reasons, of course.

So far, I must say, I'm pretty impressed by the build quality as well as the utility factor.

With this pimping, I added the SAK into my EDC knive rotation, again. 😎️
