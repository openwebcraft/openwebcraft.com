Title: Stresstest Argon POLY+ Raspberry Pi 4 Vented Case with PWM 30mm Fan with and without thermal pad

Text:

In the process of evaluating case options for the upgrade of a "Poor Man's Raspberry Pi NAS"  from a (link: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/ text: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2) to a (link: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/ text: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.5) I stresstested the  (link: https://argon40.myshopify.com/products/draft-argon-poly-raspberry-pi-4-vented-case-with-pwm-30mm-fan text: Argon POLY+ Raspberry Pi 4 Vented Case with PWM 30mm Fan).

I appliyed the following PWM setting, which will start the Mini Fan at CPU Temp 55 degrees Celcius:

```bash
# /boot/config.txt
dtoverlay=gpio-fan,gpio-pin=18,temp=55000
```

Then, ~~out of sheer stupidity~~ accidentally, I had to conduct two test runsâ€”so that you don't have to. Your are welcome! ðŸ™ˆ

1. *My Test*:  without thermal pad installed
2. *My Test 2*: **with** thermal pad installed

Yes, also the naming ("*My Test*") is ðŸ‘Œ

The stressberry setup and run configuration:  

```bash
# setup
sudo apt install stress
pip3 install stressberry --user
pip3 install --upgrade numpy

# stresstest run
~/.local/bin/stressberry-run -n "My Test" -d 1800 -i 300 -c 4 mytest.out
#~/.local/bin/stressberry-run -n "My Test 2" -d 1800 -i 300 -c 4 mytest2.out

# stressberry plot PNG image 
MPLBACKEND=Agg ~/.local/bin/stressberry-plot mytest.out -f -d 300 -f -l 400 1600 -t 30 90 -o mytest.png --not-transparent
# MPLBACKEND=Agg ~/.local/bin/stressberry-plot mytest2.out -f -d 300 -f -l 400 1600 -t 30 90 -o mytest2.png --not-transparent
```

Here are the results:

(image: stressberry-run-d_1800-i_300-c_4_mytest_with_thermalpad.png caption: **with** thermal pad installed)

Not really surprising, right?  ðŸ™ƒ

Though, bottom line: I really like the caseâ€”also b/c the fan is really silent. ðŸ¤«
