Evaluating *org.gnome.Epiphany* (a.k.a *GNOME Web*) on desktop Linux: "A simple, clean, beautiful view of the web"‚Ä¶

(image: epiphany-3-32.jpg)

Today I stumbled on Aral's blog post [Enabling Better Blocker in GNOME Web](https://ar.al/2018/07/17/enabling-better-blocker-in-gnome-web/), which dates back to July 2018. 

Since I'm looking forward to receiving two Linux smartphones this year (2020)‚Äîthe [Pinephone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) and the [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/)‚ÄîI figured, I should give the then likely to-become mobile standard browser a try:

```bash
sudo apt install epiphany-browser
```

## Configure build-in Ad(Content)-Blocking to use Better Blocker's list

While doing so, enabling [Better Blocker](https://better.fyi/) seems the right thing to do.

Especially, as I'm still using the Better Blocker on my iPhone. Though, since my switch to Linux as my daily driver (end of 2017), I only make very occasional use of Better for macOS on my MacBook Pro.

As it tuns out, the `gesettings` key `adblock-filters` changed:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.Epiphany adblock-filters "['https://better.fyi/blockerList.txt']"
No such key ‚Äúadblock-filters‚Äù
```

A quick `gsettings list-keys org.gnome.Epiphany` reveals the (new?) name of the settings key: `content-filters`.

And with this key, let's enable the Better rules:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.Epiphany content-filters "['https://better.fyi/blockerList.txt']"
```

## Configure Sync (w/ Firefox 

Well, enabling this feature in the Preferences tab **Sync** was very straight-forward.

And as far as I can tell, syncing my Firefox bookmarks als well as passwords did work smoothly, w/ out any issue.

Though, I recognized, that Epiphany's password manager does match the site's url much more accurate (i.e. `domain.tld/path`) than Firefox (only `domain.tld`)‚Äìcausing many of my safed passwords NOT to be found. Not yet sure, which approach I prefer ü§îÔ∏è‚Ä¶

## Nice ~~Features~~ Utilities

- Right-Click **Insert Emoji‚Ä¶** on `<input/>` and `<textarea/>` elements
