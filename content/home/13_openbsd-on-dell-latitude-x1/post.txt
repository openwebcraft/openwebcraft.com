Title: OpenBSD on Dell Latitude X1

----

Text:

Even though I'm far from switching to *bsd as my daily driver I'm eager to have a OpenBSD laptop around. And as I feel the need to switch my Thinkpad X270 back from OpenBSD 6.8 to Linuxâ€”for reasonsâ€”I installed OpenBSD 6.8 on an rather old *i368* laptop: a Dell Latitude X1... 

## Installation

The overall installation, including the setup of full disk encryption, was pretty simple and straightforwardâ€”as usual. I really enjoy the OpenBSD install experience, very slick!

Starting w/ downloading the latest `installXX.iso` for i368 from https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Download and flashing it onto a  USB drive.

While in the past, for the actual installation, I was successfully and happily following [Roman's install](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/install.html) ([git src repo](https://github.com/romanzolotarev/rgz/blob/master/openbsd/install.md)), this time around, I followed this recipe: [Installing OpenBSD 6.8 with disk encryption (+ FVWM ricing)](https://medium.com/@crhenr/installing-openbsd-6-7-with-disk-encryption-fvwm-ricing-b6fb7e2073e6) (but actually, w/ out configuring or ricing FVWM, as my window manager of choice is (still) i3wm)

Post install:

```bash
su -
# echo 'permit username' > /etc/doas.conf

# sysptach

# rcctl enable apmd
# rcctl set apmd flags -A -z 7
# rcctl start apmd

# echo "keyboard.bell.volume=0" >> /etc/wsconsctl.conf
```

## The Hardware

The hardware is quite outdated:

- CPU: Intel Pentium M ~1 GHz
- Ram: 1.2 GB

Right away, I was tempted to replace the HDD w/ an SSD... but, unfortunately, it's a 1.8" HDD w/ a 50 pin connector (PATA?). And, as it turns out, one can't get hold of such an SSD anymore. At least, it seems impossible doing so at a decent price point.

I even looked into a adapter option, using a Compact Flash Card instead... only to discover that the Dell Latitude X1 actually has a dedicated slot for a CF Card. But, as I do not have a decently sized CF around, I went w/ the HDDâ€”for now.  

## Software & Ricingâ€”WORK-IN-PROGRESS

```bash
# Install i3-gaps
doas pkg_add i3-gaps
mkdir -p /.config/i3
cp /usr/local/share/examples/i3status/i3status.conf ~/
cp /usr/local/share/examples/i3/config ~/.config/i3/

echo "setxkbmap -layout de -variant nodeadkeys -option caps:escape" > .xinitrc
echo "exec i3" > ~/.xsession
doas rcctl enable xenodm
```

Use `urxvt` as terminal emulator:

```bash
doas pkg_add rxvt-unicode
# vi ~/.config/i3/config
# bindsym Mod1+Return exec /usr/local/bin/urxvt
```

To be continued, eventually (though likely not ðŸ™ˆ)
