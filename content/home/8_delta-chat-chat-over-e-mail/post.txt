The team of the open source messenger application [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat/) just recently released their iOS client‚Ä¶

*Delta Chat* really is such a brilliant and well executed-upon idea: **instant messaging over email**‚Äîas in IMAP, SMTP‚Äîwhile still rocking end-to-end encryption (via [rPGP](https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp)) and most importantly: a great UX for non-tech users. 

The team of *Delta Chat* has really done an amazing job in developing a suite of client application for nearly all*) major operating system, both desktop and mobile ‚Äî‚Ä∫ [get.delta.chat](https://get.delta.chat/):

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
- iOS (App Store and Beta via Testflight)
- Android (Play Store and `*.apk` download)

*) the BSDs being the exception, for now

If you're‚Äîlike me‚Äîan email fan-boy and into federation and decentralization ‚òùÔ∏èTHIS is a MUST to try out, seriously!!

So far the user experience‚Äîeven on multiple devices‚Äìis really great. As an example: I've just successfully setup two (Autocrypt capable) devices to use the same account. 

1. create backup of chats in client/ app on one device, store on shared (network/ cloud) storage
2. install app on 2nd devices
3. import chats from back
4. on first devices [Advanced settings / Send Autocrypt Setup message](https://delta.chat/en/help#can-i-use-delta-chat-on-multiple-devices-at-the-same-time)‚Ä¶
5. receive "Autocrypt Setup Message" *) on 2nd devices along w/ prompt for security number‚Äîonce entered one is good to go for sending and receiving E2E-encrypted messages with your communication partners on both devices. üòéÔ∏è

*) Note: the "Autocrypt Setup Message" will appear in your INBOX folder
