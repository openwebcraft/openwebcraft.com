Title: ZenJournal—simple and efficient journaling

Text:

Finally, a fast, simple (a.k.a. zero-stress) journaling app w/ privacy in mind: [ZenJournal](https://thezenjournal.com)

I REALLY dig the simple—even minimalistic—but yet efficient and aesthetically pleasant experience of the app (iOS and Android).

For me, the app totally nails the core functionality of a journaling app that I'm FINALLY ~~liking~~ love to use.
