Title: MNT Reform open source laptopâ€”DIY Edition

Text:

I've losely followed (link: https://mntmn.com/reform/ text: the project) (link: https://mntmn.com/reform/reform-beta-1.html text: over the years) and ultimately backed the (link: https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/reform text: crowdfunding campaign on Crowd Supply) back in May 2020 and received my DIY Kit in March 2021. In between I've followed Luka's and team, mostly on twitter.

I must say, I was very much looking forward to receiving my Reformâ€”actually much more so, than any of "the other"â„¢ handheld/terminal/laptop/â€¦ devices that I've backed over the years. ðŸ™ˆ

BTW I'm already eagerly awaiting a likely/ maybe(?) crowdfunding campaign for the (link: https://twitter.com/mntmn/status/1395740702081011714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1395740702081011714%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fmntmn2Fstatus2F1395740702081011714widget%3DTweet text: Pocket Reform) a handheld/ terminal type device that Lukas et al. are currently prototypingâ€¦

## DIY Kit Assembly

The actuall assembly of the kit was pretty straight forwardâ€”not b/c I'm particularly talented (I'm not), rather thanks to Lukas' great and beautifully layouted (link: https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/mnt-reform2-diy-manual-r1.pdf text: assembly guide/ instructions) and (link:  https://mntre.com/reform2/handbook/ text: handbook). 

## Alternative OS Support and Booting

The OOTB experience of the default Debian GNU/Linux system image for Reform ((link: https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-system-image text: src)) is really great: there are two desktop environments (Sway and GNOME) and additional scripts nicely pre-configured. Though, I'm actually even more curious about putting an alternative OSâ€”be it another Linux Distro or maybe even OpenBSD ðŸ¤”â€”onto my Reform: 

> You should be able to use any distro if you use the supplied kernel and DTS (Image and .dtb files in the root (/) directory of the SD card).
> Plus, copy /sbin/reform-init to the new system as well.
> You might want the other stuff from reform-tools as well: (link: https://source.mnt.re/reform/reform-system-image/-/tree/main/reform2-imx8mq/reform-tools_1.0-6 text: reform2-imx8mq/reform-tools_1.0-6) 
> Some more details on system boot are here: (link: https://mntre.com/reform2/handbook/advanced.html#system-boot text: Advanced Topics â€” MNT Reform Operator Handbook documentation) 
>The reform-init script mentioned at the end lets you dynamically change the rootfs after the kernel is up, based on the text file /reform-boot-medium. It is something that is traditionally done in initramfs, but MNT Reform does not use an initramfs by default. After re-mounting the filesystem root (also supports LUKS), reform-init passes control to the real init of your distro.
