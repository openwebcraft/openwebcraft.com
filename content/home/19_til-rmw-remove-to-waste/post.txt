Title: TIL rmwâ€”Remove to Waste

----

Text:

I've learned about a nice litle cli utitliy: (link: https://theimpossibleastronaut.github.io/rmw-website text: rmw)

> *rmw* (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove utility for the command line.
> It can move and restore files to and from directories specified in a configuration file, and can also be integrated with your regular desktop trash folder (if your desktop environment uses the FreeDesktop.org Trash specification). 
> â€”src: remove-to-waste.info

The utitliy is written in C, open source, and has a GNU GPLv3 License.

And.It.Just.Works.

On first usage it creats a default configuration file at `~/.config/rmwrc`  along w/ a default waste directory structure at `~/.local/share/Waste`.

To make it work w/ my GNOME desktop (on Debian Buster) I only hat to adjust the path to the waste directory like so:

```yaml
# ~/.config/rmwrc
WASTE = $HOME/.local/share/Trash
```

I can now ~~delete~~ remove a file to ~~trash~~ waste like so: 

```shell
rmw some-file-to-be-deleted.txt
```

To ultimately purge the file, I just need to *Empty Trash* from GNOME Files app, which I do anyway ðŸ¤ž.
