Title: Enjoying a CMS—Kirby Edition

I'm (link: website-tech text: now using Kirby) as the content management system for this website.
Sure, this might come as a surprise to everyone who—for years in a row—heard me preaching:
>"*Headless CMS & Static Site Generation FTW!*".  

But after a closer look, the surprise isn't that big actually:

1. on the tech side of things, also Kirby can be used "headless" (thanks to it's (link: https://getkirby.com/plugins/getkirby/kql text: Kirby Query Language API)) and it likewise can generate a static site;
2. secondly, and this is where Kirby really stood out rather quickly to me (after I got introduced to it in the context of a customer project—that ironically picked Wordpress instead) is the **elegant approach** of the product, rooted in and aiming for **simplicity**—for it's (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/blueprints/introduction text: customizability), the clean  (link: https://getkirby.com/features/creators text: user interface (admin panel)), the (link: https://github.com/getkirby/kirby text: code base), it's (link: https://getkirby.com/plugins text: extensibility), the (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/reference text: documentation);
