Text:

Just today, I've stumbled on [Datacake](https://datacake.co/) (SaaS). I must admit: I was intrigued right away by them claiming:
1. they offer a *low-code IoT platform*
2. w/ *out of the box support for Devices, Gateways, and LoRaWANÂ® Networks*
3. and all made in Germany. ðŸ¤” 

1.-2-3 reasons to give it a tryâ€¦
