Title: Clear Linux on 12" MacBook8,1

----

Text:

I really, really like the form factor and overall versatility of my MacBook Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015.

Therefore, it is of course also a viable target for ~~distribution hopping~~ optimizing my (mobile) work/ computing setup. ðŸ¤“

The installation is smooth and uneventfull, though an external (usb) keyboard/ mouse is required due to `applespi` drivers not being (auto) loaded at boot time and therefore the buildin keyboard and touchpad are not usable.

But this can be fixed rather easily by following Clear Linux's official documentation on how to (link: https://docs.01.org/clearlinux/latest/guides/kernel/kernel-modules.html#optional-configure-kernel-modules-to-load-at-boot text: configure kernel modules to load at boot):

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/modules-load.d

# /etc/modules-load.d/applespi.conf
spi_pxa2xx_platform
spi_pxa2xx_pci
applespi
```

Then, one is left w/ only some minor weak points:

- **Full disk encryption** using LUKS not usableâ€”b/c of missing drivers for macbook8,1 builtin keyboard in initrd for full disk encrpytion via LUKS. I opened an issue  (link: https://github.com/clearlinux/distribution/issues/2668 text: #2668).
- **Bluetooth** is not workingâ€”b/c no driver available.
- **Suspend** is not workingâ€”b/c keyboard and touchpad are available after resuming from suspend.
- **Audio** is only available via headphone jackâ€”b/c speakers and microphone are not working.
