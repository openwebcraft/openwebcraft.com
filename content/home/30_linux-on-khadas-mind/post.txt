Title: Linux on Khadas Mind

----

Text:

I backed the (link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/khadasmind/khadas-mind-your-next-gen-portable-workstation text: Kickstarter for Khadas Mind: Your Next-Gen Modular Workstation) and today (2023-11-11) recieved the (link: https://www.khadas.com/mind text: Khadas Mind Premium).

Needless to say, that I didn't plan on using Windoof 11 on this beauty. 🤓

So this page is all about me figuring out how to—best 🤞—use Linux on this device—as a daily driver.

I'm planing on leaving Windoof 11 on the SSD—a.k.a. going dual boot—to ease up my life with firmware updates.
That's actually something that I recently learned from my ~~struggle~~ experience running Linux on the (link: https://openwebcraft.com/linux-on-thinkpad-x13s-gen-1/ text: Lenovo ThinkPad X13s Gen 1)—where I ended up NOT having a dual boot setup in favour of Debian/ Ubuntu Full Disk Encryption (FDE).

I'm planing on evaluating these Linux distributions/ flavours, in no particular order:

- ✅ Intel's (link: https://www.clearlinux.org/ text: Clear Linux)
- ✅ (link: https://elementary.io/ text: elementary OS)
- ✅ Stock (link: https://www.debian.org/ text: Debian)
- ✅ (link: https://pop.system76.com/ text: Pop!_OS)
- ✅ (link: https://projectbluefin.io/ text: Bluefin)
- Stock (link: https://ubuntu.com/ text: Ubuntu)
- (link: https://vanillaos.org/ text: Vanilla OS)
- (link: https://www.openbsd.org/ text: OpenBSD) (did I say "Linux-only" 🙃)

## Clear Linux

I've opted NOT for (link: https://www.clearlinux.org/clear-linux-documentation/tutorials/multi-boot/dual-boot-win.html#method-1-shrink-windows-partition-and-install-cl text: dual-booting Clear Linux* OS and Windows* ~~10~~ 11 OS) on the same disk, but rather installed a 2nd SSD for installing Clear Linux.

The installation worked w/ out an issue—though the installer did not recognize the Wifi card, thus I had to fall back on Ethernet via external USB-C hub.

Also, after the installation Gnome seems not able to activate Bluetooth. I didn't drill into this issue, so I can't say whether it's an issue w/ the Bluetooth stack in general or (just/ likely) a driver issue, or…

BTW *Suspend* is working.

## elementary OS

Only tested w/ live medium. Worked flawlessly. Though I didn't want to install right now. I'm rather waiting for the already in the works/ upcoming 8.0 release, which will be based on Ubuntu 24.4, thus expected for 2024.

## Debian 12 (bookworm)

Installation and FDE went pretty straight forward—from `debian-12.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso` (not so much from `debian-live-12.4.0-amd64-gnome.iso`, b/c of issues w/ encryption on boot, likely installer issue?).

Went w/ minimal tiling DE leveraging Wayland and Sway via my beloved Regolith Desktop.

## Pop!_OS

Only tested w/ live medium. Worked flawlessly. Of course 🤷‍♂️

## Bluefin

REALLY curious about Bluefin. Even more though, after reading about (link: https://brian.dev/how-i-bluefin/ text: how Brian is Bluefin)…

Installed the latest iso (`bluefin-38-2023-10-27-x86_64-rc.iso`), even though still beta ("*This is an Beta and will remain a Beta until Fedora 40 is released.*"). 

Install worked w/ out any issues, even though I opted for full disk encryption.

Now need to figure out all this Silverblue/ Bluefin "magic":

> **Bluefin Developer Experience** (`bluefin-dx`) is a dedicated developer image with bundled tools. Unlike traditional Linux systems, the operating system and developer environment are explicitly and purposely decoupled.
