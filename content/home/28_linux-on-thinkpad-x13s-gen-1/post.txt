This is to document my ~~ordeal~~  *#EmbraceTheSuck* journey and **work-in-progress** of daily driving a (link: https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx/thinkpad-x13s-(13-inch-snapdragon)/21bxcto1wwus1 text: Lenovo ThinkPad X13s Gen 1).

## Windows 11

- Install BIOS Updates (via Windows App *Lenovo Commercial Vantage*)
- Install Windows 11 Updates, incl. *Windows 11, version 22H2*
- Activated Windows Feature *Hyper-V*, installed WSL2 and distros Debian and Ubuntu.
- Installed Visual Studio Code along w/ some other native-arm Windows Apps, just to see… 

## Linux

The state of Linux on the X13s is still pretty much WIP (work-in-progress), but (link: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/10a63o6/did_efforts_for_linux_on_x13s_stop_a_few_months/ text: NO it has not stopped a few month ago).

The community is eagerly awaiting the latest kernel works to arrive in distros. 

## Debian—WIP

I installed *Debian* by following along the [instructions for flashing and installing Debian (Installer for Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 laptops)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WuxE-42ZeOkKAft5FuUk6C2fonkQ8sqNZ56ZmZ49hGI/edit#heading=h.d1689esafsky) compiled by Linaro (link posted by Lenovo's Mark Pearson on [Lenovo Community Forum Post "Re:Does anybody know if there is work being done to integrate X13s (ARM-processor) with linux?"](https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/27/5175315/5770592)).

Notes:

- I created the bootable USB driver on Linux via the awesome [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) application.
- I shrinked the Windows drive on my 1TB disk by `768000` MB, resulting in 750 GB of "Unallocated" space.
- I would have preferred to install Debian with full-disk encryption and a custom sized swapfile, but this has to wait for another day 🤷‍♂️
- Modifying the boot order: `FS15:\> bcfg boot add  modf 0 EFI/debian/DtbLoader.efi "Debian"`
- After "updating" to Debian `testing` I had to re-enable `os-prober` to create a custom GRUB menu entry for Windows as documented (link: https://wiki.debian.org/DualBoot/Windows10 text: here)
- Uninstalled `regolith-desktop` ((link: https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/issues/635#issuecomment-1402333826 text: until  `arm64` repositories for Regolith are available)) and re-installed GNOME via `tasksel`.

## Fedora 

Results of Matthew Miller's poll [What do you think about Fedora Workstation on an ARM-based Lenovo laptop?](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/what-do-you-think-about-fedora-workstation-on-an-arm-based-lenovo-laptop/37322)

> Fedora developers are aiming for it being supportable/usable in time for Fedora 38, at some point before that, some consumable images will be released for testing.
