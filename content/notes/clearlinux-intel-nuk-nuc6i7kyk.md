End of 2016 I've asked myself again (like every year before): "Is 2017 the Year of the Linux Desktop — **also for me**?" This question triggered a short desktop hardware shopping but rather looong-ish *Distro Hopping* endeavour — **which ended in a suprise** (#spoileralert)…

## Hardware

- [Mini PC Intel® NUC Kit NUC6i7KYK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc6i7kyk-features-configurations.html?_ga=2.191377450.1270086085.1503085023-23391726.1501445746) (a.k.a **NUC Skull Canyon**)
- **32GB RAM** (2x Crucial 16GB DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) SODIMM CT16G4SFD8213)
- **2x** Samsung SSD 960 PRO **512GB**, M.2

## Software

- ~~Debian 8 *Jessie*~~
- ~~Arch Linux~~ (though quite happy for +4 month)
- ~~RHEL 7~~
- Debian 9 *Stretch* (my goto fallback, because: "Debian always and forever")
- NixOS (currently evaluating on 2nd drive…)

**OS of choice (as of writing): [Clear Linux](https://clearlinux.org/)** from Intel's Open-Source Technology Center

While the *Clear Linux Project for Intel® Architecture* is actually built…

- primarily for various Cloud use cases
- and to showcase "the best of Intel architecture technology and performance, from low-level kernel features to complex applications that span across the entire OS stack"

…the emphasis on Power and Performance optimizations along w/ the (rather recent) [switch from Xfce to GNOME](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=clear-linux-gnome&num=1) makes for **a pretty nice desktop experience.**
