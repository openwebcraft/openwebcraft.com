I’m home in Donauwoerth, Germany.

## What I’m doing now

How I spend my day (in order of time spent):

- family (ie. parenting my two children, housework duties)
- remote technology consulting (limited hours, fixed commitments)
- running
- family…
- side projects (#webdev, Linux (on Mobile), Docker, Node.js, Go, #perfmatters, #offlinefirst, #p2p, #smalltech, IoT, Raspberry Pi, Arduino
- family…

Those are my priorities.

## What I’m currently not doing

- ~~freelance work (REMOTE)~~ I say no to all project enquiries

If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page. Last update September 2017.
