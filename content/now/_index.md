I’m home in Donauwoerth, Germany.

## What I’m doing now

How I spend my day (in order of time spent):

- family (parenting my two children, housework duties)
- family…
- family…
- side projects (#webdev, Node.js, Go, Elm, #perfmatters, #offlinefirst, IoT, Raspberry Pi, Arduino)

Those are my priorities.

## What I’m currently not doing

- ~~freelance work (REMOTE)~~ I say no to all project enquiries

If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page. Last update February 2016.
