I'm a web developer and Technical Architect — living in and working REMOTE from [Donauwoerth](http://www.donauwoerth.de/) in Bavaria, Germany.

I’m dedicated to the [Open Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/standards/), web technology and open source software in general. I hold a Degree in Business Information Technology.

This website is hand-crafted with ❤ in Donauwoerth.

Built (a.k.a generated) by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [Ananke Gohugo Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/).
