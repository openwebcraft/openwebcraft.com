This is a (link: https://nownownow.com/about text: now) page that describes the things I’m focusing in at the moment.
If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page.

## What I’m doing now

I’m home in Donauwoerth, Germany.
How I spend my day (in order of time spent):
- family (ie. parenting my two children, ~~homeschooling~~, house & gardening duties)
- remote technology consulting (limited hours, fixed commitments)
- 🏃️ running & crossfit
- family…
- side projects (#webdev, Linux on Mobile, (link: https://openwebcraft.com/introducing-trimir-journal-your-personal-activity-tricorder-for-elementary-os/ text: elementary OS), OpenBSD, Docker, Node.js, Go, #perfmatters, #offlinefirst, #p2p, #smallweb, #smalltech, IoT, (link: https://openwebcraft.com/sidepi-my-portable-versatile-raspberry-pi-4-development-server-setup/ text: Raspberry Pi)
- family…

Those are my priorities.
