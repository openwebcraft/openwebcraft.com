## What I’m doing now

I’m home in Donauwoerth, Germany.

How I spend my day (in order of time spent):

- family (i.e. parenting our two children and our dog 🐾, ~~homeschooling~~, house & gardening duties, …)
- remote technology consulting (limited hours, fixed commitments)
- 🏃️ running—currently more going for a walk 🦮, some crossfit
- family…
- nerdy side projects (Linux ~~on Mobile~~ (link: https://openwebcraft.com/linux-on-thinkpad-x13s-gen-1/ text: ARM64), (link: https://openwebcraft.com/introducing-trimir-journal-your-personal-activity-tricorder-for-elementary-os/ text: elementary OS), (link: https://openwebcraft.com/kirby-and-httpd-8-on-openbsd-also-static-site-generation/ text: OpenBSD), #webdev, #perfmatters, #devops, #offlinefirst, #p2p, #smallweb, #smalltech, IoT, (link: https://openwebcraft.com/stressberry-the-argon-poly-raspberry-pi-4-vented-case-with-pwm-30mm-fan-with-and-without-thermal-pad/ text: Raspberry Pi), …)
- family…
- optimizing my everyday carry (#edc), actually rather collecting 🤣 
- family…

Those are my priorities.
