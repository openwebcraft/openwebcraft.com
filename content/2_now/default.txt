This is a (link: https://nownownow.com/about text: now) page that describes the things I’m focusing in at the moment.
If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page.

## What I’m doing now

I’m home in Donauwoerth, Germany.
How I spend my day (in order of time spent):
- family (ie. parenting my two children, homeschooling, housework and gardening duties)
- remote technology consulting (limited hours, fixed commitments)
- running
- family…
- side projects (#webdev, Linux on Mobile, OpenBSD, Docker, Node.js, Go, #perfmatters, #offlinefirst, #p2p, #smallweb, #smalltech, IoT, Raspberry Pi
- family…

Those are my priorities.

## What I’m currently not doing

- ~~freelance work (REMOTE) I currently say no to all project inquiries~~
