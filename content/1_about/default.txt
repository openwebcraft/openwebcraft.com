I like to refer to my professional self as an **Open Web Craftsman**â€”hence the domain name for this (link: website-tech text: hand-crafted) website ðŸ™ƒ.

Iâ€™m a Freelance Developer, Technical Architect and Consultant, living in and working remotely from Donauwoerth in Bavaria, Germany. I have more than 20 years of hands-on (think: dirty hands) software development experience, with a focus on the "web stack" in online commerce. For building and assembling solutions I ~~usually~~ exclusively lean towards leveraging open source technologies and cloud-native products and services. I've also done a fair amount of technical project management and strategy consulting amongst several industries. I initially started out with a Degree in Business Information Technology.

Iâ€™m passionate about free softwareâ€”*free* as in "freedom of speech" or libreâ€”and open hardware, as well as the (link: https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/ text: Small Web ), Linux/ Unix/ BSDs and open source software in general.
