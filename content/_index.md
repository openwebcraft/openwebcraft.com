# Hej!
Welcome to my website and occasional (tech) [notes](/notes/). Enjoy!

## About me

I'm a web developer and Technical Architect — living in and working REMOTE from [Donauwoerth](http://www.donauwoerth.de/) in Bavaria, Germany.

I’m dedicated to the [Open Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/standards/), web technology and open source software in general. I hold a Degree in Business Information Technology.

This website is hand-crafted with ❤ in Donauwoerth. Built by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
