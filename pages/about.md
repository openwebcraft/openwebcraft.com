I'm <span class="adr">living in/ working remote from <span class="locality"><a href="http://www.donauwoerth.de/">Donauwoerth</a></span>, <span class="country-name">Germany</span>.</span></p></div>

I'm a full stack web developer, software architect and project manager dedicated to open web standards, open source software and semantic web technologies. I hold a Degree in Business Information Technology.

I started **open**webcraft as my freelance side business in 2011 against the background of  more than 10 years of professional experience in software development, system integration, project management, both leading and mentoring engineering and consulting teams.

### My Experience

During my professional career - working in large scale enterprises to mid-size companies and start-up ventures - I gained both, deep insights into various business domains, processes and industries as well as broad know-how and hands-on experience in software engineering for the web.

Being passionate about web technologies in general I worked on several projects and consulting engagements - both, for Enterprise Software and not:

- **E-Commerce** (B2C, B2B) - being the focus of recent years
- PIM, Product and Information Management
- (Web) Content Management
- (Enterprise) Document Management
- CRM
- (Enterprise) Portals, Intranets, Extranets
- Knowledge Management/ E-Learning

### My Skill Set

**Software Architecture & Web Development**

- Java, PHP
- Ruby, Rails/ Sinatra
- JavaScript/ [Node.js]
- HTML5, CSS3
- <abbr title="Test Driven Development ">TDD</abbr>, "Continous Everything" (Build, Integration, Deployment, ...)

**Project Management & Technology Consulting**

- Agile, Waterfall
- Strategic Technology Consultation
- <abbr title="Open Source Software">OSS</abbr> Platform Selection
- Project CTO

### Networking

While **open**webcraft itself is mainly a freelance (a.k.a me lone) type of business it's embedded into a larger "virtual" business entity called [Kaminrun.de] (yes, you guessed its origin ;-) ).

The [Kaminrun.de] is a network of five like minded IT and Online Marketing professionals located in the Augsburg - Donauwoerth region. The Kaminrunde has several years of web development and e-commerce project experience - working together as a highly complementary team.

The additional skill set of the team:

- Visual Design (<abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>, Branding, Information Architecture, Content Guidelines, Conversion Optimization)
- Online Marketing (Web Analytics, <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, <abbr title="Search Engine Advertising">SEA</abbr>)
- Senior Web Development (PHP, Ruby)
- System Engineering (*nix, Windows)

### Software Craftsmanship

I'm a signatory of the [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

> As aspiring **Software Craftsmen** we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft.

> **Software craftsmanship** is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers themselves. It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the mainstream software industry, including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer accountability.
